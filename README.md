Spring Framework

> The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform. The framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE platform. Although the framework does not impose any specific programming model, it has become popular in the Java community as an alternative to, replacement for, or even addition to the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) model. The Spring Framework is open source. [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Framework)

#Core Spring

- primary features are 
	- dependency injection ( DI )

##Springing into action

###1.1 Simplifying Java development

> Spring’s usefulness isn’t limited to server-side development. Any Java application can benefit from Spring in terms of simplicity, testability, and loose coupling.

Spring employs four key strategies:

- Lightweight and minimally invasive development with POJOs
- Loose coupling through DI and interface orientation
- Declarative programming through aspects and common conventions
- Eliminating boilerplate code with aspects and templates
